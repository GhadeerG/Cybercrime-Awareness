# Phishing Websites (MVP)

In this repository, I'll be gladly sharing all the materials i worked on for the first Project in SDAIA Data Science Bootcamp.

The project is about how to recognize and differentiate between links that considered as suspicious "Phishing" link or not.

To catch that goal, I took all the symbols that potentially stuffed in the phishing links and represented them in the pie chart since it's categorical data to see which factor will be the red flag to the user, as we can see below that the the_URL_length is the most likely factor considered.

The top 5 symbols come right after "the_URL_length" are slash then dot, tld, hyphen, equal as you can see in the below bar chart

However, the repetition of these symbols should notify the target user to be careful.

Good protection from phishing comes first by educating myself and people around me.
