# Phishing-Websites EDA

In this repository, I'll be gladly sharing all the materials i worked on for the first Project in SDAIA (Saudi Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence) T5 Data Science Bootcamp.

This project is about how to recognize and differentiate between links that are considered suspicious "Phishing" links or not, and how much people are aware of that.

Could this link be a phishing link?

To catch that goal, first, I analyzed a local dataset that used to measure the level of cybersecurity awareness of cybercrime in Saudi Arabia.
The most important question was: How much do you check the legitimacy of a website before accessing it? the answer in the pie chart down.

Almost 42% of Saudis in this sample check the source of the link which is a good indication of the cybercrime awareness but let's see how much of them got phished at least once since they started using the internet.

22% got phishsed! How can I -As a tech savvy/Data Scientist- notify them?

Let's see that in the Project Write_Up.
